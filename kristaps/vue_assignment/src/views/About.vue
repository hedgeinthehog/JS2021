      This assignment was completed quite late, the time is 04:04 and my brain says 'sleep not found'. So I apologize for bugs and the messy code.
      <br>
      I hope to become a great front-end developer in future. I also love drawing and playing video games. Sometimes I do some streaming on Twitch which is the reason this assignment was completed so late. I have also worked on Android apps, mobile games and graphic design in past.
